# TODOs

## Plotting script for evaluation metrics
- [ ] Define name for error metric that measures cartesian distances between corresponding locations on the wire harness
- [ ] Plot error error metric measuring cartesian distances between corresponding parts of the wire harness
- [ ] Plot error metric measuring cartesian distance between two poses
- [ ] Plot error metric measruing rotational distance between two poses

## Figure for ground truth by markers and labeling

## Initialization experiments
- [ ] write section
- [ ] rework figure of low vs high noise and outlier ratio: more clearly convey the point that different backgrounds determine the ration of noise and outliers. (E.g. statistical graph showing the percentage of points that are outliers, or grah that shows the percentage of occlusion?) OR jsut reduce the complexity of the figure highlighting noise and outliers graphically.
- [ ] Rework figure for representing the experiment workflow --> reduce to one example.
- [ ] Rework figure for representing results as images --> reduce size by giving 3 esamples from low nosie and 3 examples from high noise.
- [ ] Rework representation of results --> figure + diagram spit into low and high disturabene.
- [ ] Change color scheme of figures
- [ ] Rework table for result representation
- [ ] Rework tabe for runtime evaluation

## Tracking experiments
- [ ] write section
- [ ] figure for input data
- [ ] rework figure for CPD / SPR / KPR comparison
    - enlarge 3D visualization --> no axes
    - color code the individual branches
    - Do not visualize the reprojected result
    - only one column with images make the rest be 3D plots
- [ ] add figure to highlight differences between the 3 methods --> pick one frame where CPD / SPR perfrom badly --> showcase why.
- [ ] change color scheme of the evaluation
    - CPD -> black
    - SPR -> dark blue
    - KPR -> light blue

## Tracking experiments on pose estimation
- [ ] write section
- [ ] fill out result tables
- [ ] Replot images with  color scheme for (CPD, SPR, KPR)
- [ ] Plot a legend that clearly conveys the color scheme --> not in images
